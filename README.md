As my fifth project, I made a standard ToDoList to test my knowledge of javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Considering how simple this project is, there isn't much I can say about it. My only goal was to make the ToDo list have functions such as deleting items and checking them off as they are completed.

Because I was investing a lot of time and effort into learning coding (JavaScript specifically) at this point, making something this simple was easy and quick for me.

This took me about 6 hours to make.
